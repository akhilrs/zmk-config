# ZMK Config for 5-Column Corne-ish Zen V2 with E-Ink


This repository contains the configuration files for a custom 5-column Corne-ish Zen V2 keyboard running [ZMK firmware](https://zmk.dev/). This build features support for an E-Ink display, RGB lighting, and a compact 5-column layout. The configuration is inspired by and based on the [urob/zmk-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config) and [zmk-config-zen-2](https://github.com/a741725193/zmk-config-zen-2) repositories.
